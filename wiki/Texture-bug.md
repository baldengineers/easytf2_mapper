When using rotated rotated prefabs, you may get geometry with stretched out textures, like this:

This will cause the lighting in the map to become broken, as well as look ugly from any standpoint. However, this can be manually, yet easily fixed. The first step is to select everything in your map. Do this by dragging a selection over everything in the overhead grid, like this:

After the selection encompasses everything on the map, hit enter so everything becomes selected.

Once you've got that done, navigate to the Face Edit Menu, here:

From that menu, you're going to want to check the "Align - World" checkbox making the check black rather than grey, resolving this bug.
