readme:

INSTALLATION~~~~~~~~
Install either the source code or executable. If you have the executable, run the EasyTF2Mapper.exe, or if you have the
source code, run main.py. A more in-depth instruction can be found on the wiki here: https://github.com/baldengineers/easytf2_mapper/wiki/Installation

You may have an older version, in which case run the Updater executable.

SHORTCUTS~~~~~~~~~
Ctrl+G = resize grid. deletes all blocks. For every 1 grid square in the mapper, it's 512 hammer units in hammer.

Ctrl+B = choose skybox texture. I reccommend choosing one that you want, the default is pretty bland.

Ctrl+S = Save file as a .ezm. This saves your work so far, and can be used by others, after restarting, or how any other save works.
You can upload and download these saves at http://tf2mapper.com/uploads/index.html

Ctrl+Shift+S = Save as. Works like any other "save as" function.

Ctrl+O = Open a save file. Opens .ezm savefiles.

Ctrl+E = Export vmf. Do this when you're done if you want to make some changes or just want a .vmf. This will export, then give you an option to launch your .vmf into hammer.

Ctrl+Shift+E = Export as a .bsp. This is a fully compatible TF2 map file. It will be put into your maps directory as tf2mapperoutput.bsp. You can open this in TF2 by typing 'map tf2mapperoutput' in console or by creating an offline/lan server with the map being 'tf2mapperoutput'. There might be some lighting problems, as it's a quick compile.

Ctrl+I = Create your own prefab. When creating a prefab, make it in the lower right quadrant of the grid, with one corner touching the
origin. Make the ground a 64 high 512*512 block for uniformity. Report bugs with this to toadsrc@gmail.com, as this is probably the
buggiest part of the program. You can choose to export a prefab, which puts it in a zip in the home directory of the mapper.

Ctrl+Shift+I = Import prefab. This opens up a dialog asking for a zip generated by another user and puts that prefab into your program. You can upload these zips at http://tf2mapper.com/uploads/index.html. Experimental right now, but works fairly well.

Ctrl+H = Opens Hammer. The first time you do this, you might have to point the program to your hammer.exe.

Ctrl+B = Choose skybox from a list. This will make the skybox of the rendered map the one you chose.

Ctrl+Q/Alt+f4 = Quit

Ctrl+Z = Undo

Ctrl+Shift+Z = Redo

Ctrl+click on a square with a prefab on it to remove whatever was on it.

Press ` or ~ to open the developer console. You probably don't need it.





After exporting, open the .vmf in hammer, or choose the option on the popup to load your file straight into hammer.
