readme:

INSTALLATION~~~~~~~~
Install either the source code or executable. If you have the executable, run the EasyTF2Mapper.exe, or if you have the
source code, run main.py. A more in-depth instruction can be found on the wiki here: https://github.com/baldengineers/easytf2_mapper/wiki/Installation

You may have an older version, in which case run the Updater executable.

SHORTCUTS~~~~~~~~~
Ctrl+G = resize grid. deletes all blocks. For every 1 grid square in the mapper, it's 512 hammer units in hammer.

Ctrl+B = choose skybox texture. I reccommend choosing one that you want, the default is pretty bland.

Ctrl+S = Save file as a .ezm. This saves your work so far, and can be used by others, after restarting, or how any other save works.
You can upload and download these saves at http://tf2mapper.com/uploads/index.html

Ctrl+Shift+S = Save as. Works like any other "save as" function.

Ctrl+O = Open save. Opens .ezm savefiles.

Ctrl+E = Export vmf. do this when you're done. This will export, then give you an option to launch your .vmf into hammer.

Ctrl+I = Create your own prefab. When creating a prefab, make it in the lower right quadrant of the grid, with one corner touching the
origin. Make the ground a 64 high 512*512 block for uniformity. Report bugs with this to toadsrc@gmail.com, as this is probably the
buggiest part of the program.

Ctrl+H = Opens Hammer. The first time you do this, you might have to point the program to your hammer.exe.

Ctrl+B = Choose skybox from a list. This will make the skybox of the rendered map the one you chose.

Ctrl+Q/Alt+f4 = Quit

Ctrl+click on a square with a prefab on it to remove whatever was on it.

Press ` or ~ to open the developer console. You probably don't need it.





After exporting, open the .vmf in hammer, or choose the option on the popup to load your file straight into hammer.
